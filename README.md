# My_Lists
- Because to my knowledge, there's too troublesome to update my lists to social media. And their features are probably not enough for my needs (write memo, short review, rating...)
- Simple list to keep update of my book list, watch list, wish list...
- When somebody asks me if I've ever heard or watched this movie, then I could just reference to this repo

# My book list
- Few of the books I keep hard cover copies, but most of them are in digital form

# Requirements
For every list there should be a appropriate template but, in the simplest term
- Name
- Author
- Tags...

# Todolist
- Looks like there should be an app or website designed for this only purpose
- Somebody should keep their personal list, and this could be an interesting project for IT developers :), unfortunately I'm not one.

3 February 2021:
This list is deprecated and shouldn't be updated anymore cause I've move all my list cho personal Access file for better management.
